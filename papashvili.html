  <h1>My Story</h1>
<div>
		<strong><p>How and Why I started dancing?</p>
	I always wanted to be physically active, healthy, and always in shape. Latin Dances was the best choice for me. It was a great opportunity to be involved in dancing life. Walking into the studio the first time was like walking into a dream. What I found was music playing, couples dancing, laughter, and an aura of friendliness. I was nervous, to say the least, but decided to go through with it. It seemed to me to be such a lovely place and I was right. The dance supervisor took me by the hand, sat me down, and explained everything to me. He asked me what I hoped to get from this experience and how long I had been thinking about learning to dance. I will be always grateful for the experience and skills which I gained during that period of time.
	<p>How I started dancing?</p></strong>
	<strong>

When I was 12 years old, there’s was one tv show “dancing with the stars” which had a huge impact on me. When when I first watched the show I really enjoyed and inspired by its costumes and dancing style. Therefore I and my mom decided to start Latin-American dances. I went one of the famous dancing studio in my home country Tbilisi. There started my first steps in my dancing career.</strong>
